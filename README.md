# Project Specifications
This project is intended to simulate Block Set Associative (BSA) Cache Mapping with the Most Recently Used (MRU) replacement policy. The project was programmed in Java, with the JavaFX library used for developing the graphical user interface (GUI). The cache simulation system follows these specifications:
 - 16 cache blocks
 - 32 words per cache line
 - Load-through read policy
 - User-specified number of memory blocks
